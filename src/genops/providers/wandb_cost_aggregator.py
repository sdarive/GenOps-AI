GenOps W&B Cost Aggregation

This module provides comprehensive cost tracking and aggregation capabilities for
Weights & Biases experiments, runs, and artifacts. It tracks costs across multiple
dimensions including compute resources, storage, data transfer, and platform services.

Features:
- Multi-dimensional cost tracking (compute, storage, data transfer)
- Campaign-level cost aggregation across multiple runs
- Team and project cost attribution with drill-down capabilities
- Resource efficiency analysis and optimization recommendations
- Budget monitoring and forecasting based on historical usage patterns
- Cost comparison across experiments and hyperparameter sweeps

Cost Categories:
- Compute Costs: GPU/CPU hours, instance types, training time
- Storage Costs: Artifact storage, dataset versioning, model checkpoints
- Data Transfer Costs: Upload/download bandwidth, API calls
- Platform Costs: W&B service usage, enterprise features

Example usage:

    from genops.providers.wandb_cost_aggregator import WandbCostAggregator
    
    aggregator = WandbCostAggregator()
    
    # Track experiment costs
    experiment_cost = aggregator.calculate_experiment_cost(
        compute_hours=2.5,
        gpu_type="v100",
        storage_gb=10.0,
        artifacts_count=5
    )
    
    # Aggregate campaign costs
    campaign_summary = aggregator.aggregate_campaign_costs(
        run_ids=["run_1", "run_2", "run_3"]
    )
    
    # Get team cost breakdown
    team_costs = aggregator.get_team_cost_breakdown(
        team="ml-engineering",
        time_period="last_30_days"
    )

Dependencies:
    - datetime: For time-based cost tracking
    - typing: For type hints and data structures
    - dataclasses: For cost data structures
    - enum: For cost category definitions
