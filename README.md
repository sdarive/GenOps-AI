# 🧭 GenOps: Open Runtime Governance for AI Systems

GenOps is an open-source runtime governance framework for AI and LLM workloads — built on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) and FinOps standards.

## 🚨 The Problem: AI Is Powerful, Opaque, and Ungoverned

AI is now core to production systems — yet most organizations are flying blind.  
Costs are rising, but that's just one symptom of a deeper governance gap.

- 💸 **Unpredictable costs** — Token usage explodes without accountability
- ⚖️ **Policy drift** — Teams deploy new models with no enforcement or oversight  
- 🔍 **Observability silos** — Logs, metrics, and traces don't connect to governance
- 🔒 **Compliance blind spots** — No runtime record of who did what, where, or why
- 🤖 **Shadow AI** — Models and prompts operate outside organizational control

The result: AI systems that are functional but unaccountable — and teams that can't answer:

**"What ran, under whose authority, and at what cost — financial, ethical, or operational?"**

Without runtime governance, AI becomes a black box: costly, risky, and impossible to trust at scale.

## 👥 Who This Is For

GenOps sits where DevOps, FinOps, and RiskOps converge — aligning engineering, finance, and compliance around a single source of operational truth.

| **Stakeholder** | **Core Need** | **What GenOps Provides** |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **CTOs / Heads of Platform** | Visibility into AI usage, cost, and risk across the enterprise | A unified control plane for runtime governance and observability |
| **DevOps / Platform Engineers** | Integration with existing telemetry and infra tooling | OpenTelemetry-native instrumentation and tracing |
| **FinOps Teams** | Transparent attribution by team, customer, and feature | Per-request cost tracking and budget enforcement |
| **Compliance & Risk Teams** | Runtime audit trails and data residency assurance | Policy telemetry and enforcement hooks with OPA compatibility |
| **Product & AI Teams** | Safe experimentation with production accountability | Governance-aware SDKs and cost-aware routing intelligence |

GenOps gives each of these roles shared visibility into AI behavior in production —  
**turning runtime data into governance, and governance into trust.**

---

## 💡 The GenOps Solution

GenOps provides cost, policy, and compliance telemetry across your AI stack, enabling teams to:

- **Track spend and efficiency** across models, teams, and customers
- **Enforce usage policies** and model governance in real time  
- **Integrate with existing** observability, billing, and compliance systems

Because GenOps emits standard OpenTelemetry traces, logs, and metrics, it plugs directly into your existing monitoring, FinOps, and policy infrastructure. GenOps standardizes and enforces runtime governance across your AI systems, turning observability data into actionable accountability.

## ⚙️ Key Capabilities

GenOps standardizes and enforces runtime governance across your AI systems.

| **Dimension** | **Example Metrics / Policies** | **Purpose** |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Cost Telemetry** | Cost per request, team, feature, or customer | Enables FinOps visibility and chargeback |
| **Policy Compliance** | Allowed models, region routing, rate limits | Prevents policy drift and shadow usage |
| **Data Residency** | Model invocation region, storage compliance | Ensures GDPR / SOC2 / FedRAMP adherence |
| **Performance Metrics** | Latency, cache hits, throughput | Optimizes efficiency and reliability |
| **Safety & Guardrails** | Toxicity filters, jailbreak detection | Enforces responsible deployment |
| **Usage Attribution** | Project, user, and customer-level metering | Enables cross-org accountability |
