## 🆘 Having Issues?

**🔧 Quick fixes for common problems:**

**Mistral Issues:**
- **\"Invalid API key\"** → Check your key: `echo $MISTRAL_API_KEY`
- **\"Unauthorized\"** → Verify key from console.mistral.ai (different format than OpenAI)
- **\"Model not found\"** → Try basic model: `mistral-tiny-2312`
- **\"Rate limit exceeded\"** → Wait or check your Mistral usage limits

**GenOps Issues:**
- **Import errors** → Install: `pip install genops-ai`
- **\"No module named 'mistralai'\"** → Install client: `pip install mistralai`
- **Cost calculation errors** → Check model name spelling and availability

**European AI Issues:**
- **GDPR questions** → See [European AI Compliance Guide](../../docs/european-ai-compliance.md)
- **Cost comparisons** → Run cost optimization examples for US vs EU analysis
- **Data residency** → All Mistral operations maintain EU data residency by default

**Still stuck?** Run the diagnostic:
```python
from genops.providers.mistral_validation import validate_setup, print_validation_result
result = validate_setup()
print_validation_result(result, detailed=True)
